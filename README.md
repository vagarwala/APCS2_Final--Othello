# APCS2_Final--Othello

Repository containing files for Vandana Agarwala's APCS Final Project - an implementation of the game Othello.  User vs. AI.
In order to run:   

Team Name:  
Project Name: Othello  

Project Plan/Outline:
- implement minimax (?) algorithm for AI
- demo version should be working fairly well
- final version should work well and look nice and beat my family members :))
Goals for Demo/Final version:
- working version, looking decent
- small kinks are acceptable
- GUI and edge cases can be improved & fixed between demo and final
- saving previous versions (for undo functionality)  can be implemented after demo version if I don't have time before then.  

- misc thoughts will go in Musings.txt as they come

Development Log:  
5/11/16: ... created repo  
5/12/16: I am now familiar with the game :P
5/14/16: Stones.pde, Field.pde, Othello.pde finished.  Started Manager.pde.  When I figure out how to actually make the AI, I know my black and white stones will flip as desired and the board will look nice. :P
